This is Air Script for mobile devices: Works on Android, Raspberry Pi and iOS (iOS is not native, ssh to a linux device like a Pi is needed.)
Air-Script is a python script to make testing the security of your WiFi network easier.
Air-Script uses aircrack-ng to crack WiFi without all the typing. Save time, type less.


*This script comes as is, there is no warranty.*
*By using this you agree to not hack WiFi networks you do not own or have permission to hack.*
*Hacking networks you do not have permission to hack is illegal. I am not responsible for your actions.*
